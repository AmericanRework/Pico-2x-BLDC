The RP2040BLDCAttempt2 firmware WILL NOT WORK on the current version of the board. Grab the new version of pins.h from the /firmware folder and you might be good. No promises though.


It is only an example/starting point if you want to roll your own servo amp and not use simplefoc. 


RP2040SimpleDC3xMTR has had 3x motors running. Check the pins.h file as well I haven't tested it but it's probably ok. I have a project up where I need to control some DC motors so this might get updated in the next year or two. Heh.
